<h2><a id='origin'>Origins of Baseball</a></h2>
	<p>The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with 				precision.<br>
	A French manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, 	possibly la soule, with similarities to baseball.<br>
	Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older 	game rounders, popular in Great Britain and Ireland.<br>
	The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little 	Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. It contains a rhymed<br> 
	description of "base-ball" and a woodcut that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to 	the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond <br>
	configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases.
	</p>
<h3>Baseball becomes a professional sport (1850s)</h3>
	<p>
	In the mid-1850s, a baseball craze hit the New York metropolitan area.By 1856, local 	journals were referring to baseball as the "national pastime" or "national game".<br>
	A year later, sixteen area clubs formed the sport's first governing body, the National 	Association of Base Ball Players. In 1858 in Corona, Queens New York, at the <br>
	Fashion Race Course, the first games of baseball to charge admission took place.<br>
	The games, which took place between the all stars of Brooklyn, including players from the 	Brooklyn Atlantics, Excelsior of Brooklyn, Putnams and Eckford of Brooklyn, and<br> 
	the All Stars of New York (Manhattan), including players from the New York 	Knickerbockers, Gothams (predecessors of the San Francisco Giants), Eagles and Empire, are 	commonly believed to be the first all-star baseball games.<br>
	In 1863, the organization disallowed putouts made by catching a fair ball on the first 	bounce. Four years later, it barred participation by African Americans.<br>
	The game's commercial potential was developing: in 1869 the first fully professional 	baseball club, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was formed and went undefeated against a 	schedule of semipro and amateur teams.<br>
	 The first professional league, the National Association of Professional Base Ball 	Players, lasted from 1871 to 1875; scholars dispute its status as a major league.

 <h2><a id='rules'>Rules and Regulations</a></h2>
 	<h3>The name of the game</h3>
 	<p>A game is played between two teams, each comprising nine players, that take turns 	playing offense (batting and baserunning) and defense (pitching and fielding).<br>
	 A pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by each team constitutes an inning. A 	game consists of nine innings (seven innings at the high school level and in doubleheaders in	 college and minor leagues).<br>
	 One team—customarily the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. 	The other team—customarily the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning.	<br>
	 The goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other team. The players on 	the team at bat attempt to score runs by circling or completing a tour of the four bases set 	at the corners of the square-shaped baseball diamond.<br>
	  A player bats at home plate and must proceed counterclockwise to first base, second 	base, third base, and back home in order to score a run.<br>
	  The team in the field attempts both to prevent runs from scoring and to record outs, 	which remove opposing players from offensive action until their turn in their team's batting 	order comes up again.<br>
	  When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning.<br>
   	If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played to resolve 	the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of 	players and innings.

	<h3>The field of play</h3>
  		<p>The game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles.<br>
		The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 	270-degree area outside them is foul territory.<br>
		The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the 	infield; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield.<br>
	 	In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber 	plate (the rubber) at its center.<br>
	 	The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which 	may be of any material and height (many amateur games are played on unfenced fields).<br>
	 	Fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of 	play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.

	<h3>Tool of the trade</h3>
    <!--Ordered list showing the commonly used equipment in baseball-->
		<ol>
			<li><strong>The Baseball</strong>:is about the size of an adult's fist, around 9 inches (23 centimeters) in circumference. It has a rubber or cork center, wound in yarn and covered in white cowhide, with red stitching.</li>
			<li><strong>The Bat</strong>:is a hitting tool, traditionally made of a single, solid piece of wood. Other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games. It is a hard round stick, about 2.5 inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter<br>
	at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob. Bats used by adults are typically around 34 inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42 inches (106 centimeters).</li>
		<li><strong>The Glove</strong>:is a fielding tool, made of padded leather with webbing between the fingers. As an aid in catching and holding onto the ball, it takes various shapes to meet the specific needs of different fielding positions.</li>

	<h2><a id='pop'>Baseball in Pop Culture</a></h2>
		<p>Writing in 1919, philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen described baseball as America's national religion. In the words of sports columnist Jayson Stark, baseball has long been <q>a unique paragon of American culture</q> a status he sees as devastated by the steroid abuse scandal.<br>
Baseball has an important place in other national cultures as well: Scholar Peter Bjarkman describes <q>how deeply the sport is ingrained in the history and culture of a nation such as Cuba, [and] how thoroughly it was radically reshaped and nativized in Japan.</q>
		</p>
	<h3>Baseball as a means of progress</h3>
		<p>The first networked radio broadcasts in North America were of the 1922 World Series: famed sportswriter Grantland Rice announced play-by-play from New York City's Polo Grounds on WJZ–Newark, New Jersey, which was connected by wire to WGY–Schenectady, New York, and WBZ–Springfield, Massachusetts.
		</p>
	<h3>Baseball in fasion</h3>
		<p>The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United 	States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, 	such as the United Kingdom.</p>

	<h3>Baseball in art</h3>
		<p>Baseball has inspired many works of art and entertainment. One of the first major examples, Ernest Thayer's poem "Casey at the Bat", appeared in 1888. A wry description of the failure of a star player in what would now be called a<br>
"clutch situation", the poem became the source of vaudeville and other staged performances, audio recordings, film adaptations, and an opera, as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media.
		</p>

<!--A block quote used to provide an example of baseball's impact on art-->
<aside>
 	<blockquote>An Excerpt from <em>"Case at the bat"</em> by Ernest Thayer<br>The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville Nine that day;<br>The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,<br> And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,<br>
 A sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game.<br> A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest<br>Clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;<br>They thought, if only Casey could get but a whack at that <br>
 They'd put up even money, now, with Casey at the bat.<br>But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,<br>And the former was a lulu and the latter was a cake;<br>So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,<br>
For there seemed but little chance of Casey's getting to the bat.<br></blockquote>

    <p>
There have been many baseball movies, including the Academy Award–winning The Pride of the Yankees (1942) and the Oscar nominees The Natural (1984) and Field of Dreams (1989).<br>
 The American Film Institute's selection of the ten best sports movies includes The Pride of the Yankees at number 3 and Bull Durham (1988) at number 5.<br>
  Baseball has provided thematic material for hits on both stage—the Adler–Ross musical Damn Yankees and record George J. Gaskin's "Slide, Kelly, Slide", Simon and Garfunkel's "Mrs. Robinson", and John Fogerty's "Centerfield".<br>
  The baseball-founded comedic sketch "Who's on First", popularized by Abbott and Costello in 1938, quickly became famous. Six decades later, Time named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century.<br>
   Baseball is also featured in various video games including MLB: The Show, Wii Sports, Kinect Sports: Season 2 and Mario Baseball.
